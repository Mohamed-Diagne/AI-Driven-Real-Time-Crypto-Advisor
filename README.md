# üöÄ AI-Driven Real Time Crypto Advisor

## Overview
This project builds a full crypto advisory system combining real-time technical analysis, AI-driven sentiment analysis, dynamic portfolio optimization, and Power BI visualization.  
It integrates data from Binance and Yahoo Finance, processes it with advanced analytics, and feeds updated insights every 5 minutes into Power BI for near real-time decision making.

## üéØ Objective
* Analyze crypto market conditions in near real-time.
* Compute technical indicators on 5-minute candles.
* Perform sentiment analysis on crypto news with TextBlob and DeepSeek AI.
* Dynamically optimize portfolio weights using Markowitz Sharpe ratio maximization.
* Automate data refresh to Power BI via batched `.py` script.

## üõ† Methodologies Implemented
**Technical Analysis:**
* SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, OBV.

**Sentiment Analysis:**
* Basic: TextBlob polarity scoring on news summaries.
* Advanced: DeepSeek AI via Ollama for enhanced sentiment classification (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and justification generation.

**Portfolio Optimization:**
* Markowitz Sharpe Ratio maximization with constraints (max weight 40%).
* Rolling 30-period window and rebalancing every 5 periods.

**Visualization and Reporting:**
* Real-time insights integrated into Power BI.
* Cumulative returns and risk profile tracked visually.
